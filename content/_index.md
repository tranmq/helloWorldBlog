# About this website

This is where I create blogs to share my knowledge and opinions on various topics.

I am considering several options for creating a blog, including Google Sites, Obsidian Publish, Medium, WordPress, Squarespace, and self-hosting. I have concluded that self-hosting is the best fit for me.

I am currently experimenting with using SSG and a hosting service, specifically Hugo and Netlify.
